## Inspiration
One out of eight women will get breast cancer in their lifetime, and every hour nearly five women die from this disease.

In 2020, there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 685 000 deaths globally. As of the end of 2020, there were 7.8 million women alive who were diagnosed with breast cancer in the past 5 years, making it the worldâ€™s most prevalent cancer. There are more loss disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by women to breast cancer globally than any other type of cancer.  Breast cancer occurs in every country of the world in women at any age after puberty but with increasing rates in later life.  

We can use machine learning to predict whether a patient will survive breast cancer or not.

## What it does
It's a Machine learning web app that takes clinical parameters about a breast cancer patient and tells whether a patient will survive breast cancer or not. 

## How we built it
For Machine Learning: Python & its libraries such as Matplotlib, Sci-kit-learn, and Pandas. <br/>
For Web: HTML, SCSS, JS, React, Node.js, Express.js

## Challenges we ran into
1. Model creation
2. Connecting 2 different technologies: ML (Python) + Web (React)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm able to connect 2 different technologies & I successfully completed this project. 

## What we learned
How to do optimizations in models.
Hot to connect javascript with python.

## What's next for Breast Cancer Survival Detection Web App
As of now in Kaggle's dataset, we have very few samples, because of this my model accuracy is 82.8%. If we have plenty of data then we can use it to train bigger models and we can deploy it in production

# How to setup project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
